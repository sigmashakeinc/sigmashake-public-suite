// Sigmacraft Director / game-master lane. ONE world-level brain that watches world
// pressure and proposes BOUNDED public beats — quest beats, rumors, danger pulses,
// summaries — off the 3s tick critical path, in its own supervised loop (NEVER its
// own world timer). It owns no authority: proposals are validated at the trust
// boundary (server/validate.js: vDirectorProposals) and only ever set narrative
// text + (for quest_beat) the PUBLIC objective. The tick (server/sigmacraft.js
// advance) translates accepted proposals into events; loot, XP, death, and market
// stay entirely outside the Director.
//
// Determinism: beats come from curated tables keyed by world pressure + tick, using
// the SAME pure FNV selection (choose/stableIndex from shared/sigmacraft.js) as the
// generator, so the Director is reproducible and socket-free in tests.
//
// Quiescence: Director output is ambient + regenerable (the objective re-proposes
// on restart), so it lives IN-MEMORY ONLY. propose() never putWorldState's, and the
// tick's director-consume never raises the persist signal — an idle/player-less
// world stays write-quiescent (PSU power safety; see the NPC lane for the same rule).
